### Connect OSMD to heartbeat

This version uses the MusicXML parser and the OSMD modules of [WebDAW](https://github.com/abudaan/webdaw-modules) and [heartbeat](https://github.com/abudaan/heartbeat) for MIDI playback.

- When the song plays active notes will light up in red
- When you click a note, the note will play
- When you control click a note, the playhead will move to that position
- You can draw a selection rectangle on the score to select a loop
- <ENTER> will play/pause song, <NUM0> will stop song
